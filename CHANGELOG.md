## [1.5.4] - 2026-05-20

### Summary
Version 1.5.4 adds PDF derivative generation support using PyMuPDF, enabling derivative creation from the first page of PDF documents. Also implements compound object grouping in CSV comparison/merge review with blanket field toggles for efficient bulk operations on compound families.

### Added
- **PDF derivative generation**: Function 3 now processes PDF files alongside images
  - Renders first page of PDF at 150 DPI using PyMuPDF (fitz)
  - Converts to high-quality JPEG derivatives (small 800x800, thumbnail 400x400)
  - Uploads to Azure with same structure as image derivatives
  - Populates `image_small` and `image_thumb` columns in CSV
  - Pure Python implementation with no external dependencies
  - Ideal for document collections, scanned materials, reports, manuscript pages
  - PyMuPDF>=1.24.0 added to python_requirements.txt
- **Compound object grouping in CSV comparison**: Function 4 preview and merge dialogs now group compound families
  - When compound children have changes, parent is automatically included and shown first

  - Children indented with `↳` arrow for visual hierarchy
  - Entire family wrapped in purple-bordered container
  - Makes it clear which records belong to the same compound object
- **Blanket field toggles for compound objects**: Interactive merge viewer (csvdiff mode) provides master controls
  - "Parent Blanket Controls" section at top of each compound family
  - One master checkbox per changed field affecting parent + all children
  - Checking/unchecking blanket toggle synchronizes all family members for that field
  - Efficient bulk accept/reject for entire compound families
  - Individual child checkboxes can still be adjusted for fine-grained control
  - Blanket toggles respect data loss warnings (disabled by default when clearing values)
  - Label: "(controls parent + children)" clarifies scope of each toggle

### Changed
- **Function 3 file type handling**: Updated to include PDF files in processable formats
  - Pre-scan counts now show "image/PDF files to process"
  - Skip messages updated to "non-image/PDF file"
  - Derivative generation detects PDF files and routes to PDF-specific handler
  - Both small and thumbnail derivatives generated from same PDF first page render

### Technical Details
- Added `import fitz` (PyMuPDF) to app.py imports
- New function `generate_pdf_derivative()` handles PDF-to-JPEG conversion with error handling
  - Opens PDF with fitz.open()
  - Validates page count (must have at least one page)
  - Renders first page using matrix scaling (zoom = dpi/72.0)
  - Converts pixmap to PIL Image via BytesIO
  - Applies same thumbnail resizing and quality settings as images
  - Catches fitz.FileDataError for corrupted PDFs
- Compound grouping logic builds parent-child relationship maps from merged DataFrame
  - Identifies parents by underscore-prefixed filenames
  - Links children via `parentid_new` and `parentid_old` columns
  - Processes changes in order, grouping families together
  - Tracks which records have been displayed to avoid duplicates
- Blanket toggle handlers use closures to capture field names and child checkbox references

  - Updates parent checkbox and all children checkboxes for that field
  - Respects disabled state (won't change disabled checkboxes)
  - Triggers page.update() to refresh UI immediately

## [1.5.3] - 2026-05-15

### Summary
Version 1.5.3 implements underscore-prefixed filename indexing for compound parent objects, establishing filename as the universal source of truth for ALL objects and eliminating the need for objectid fallback logic. Also adds automatic derivative URL population for compound parents in Function 3, implements clickable status messages for log access, enforces row order preservation in Function 4 CSV merge operations, and introduces network-mount-agnostic file-to-ID mapping.

### Changed
- **Function 2 Azure uploads**: Now skips files that already exist in Azure
  - Before: Re-uploaded all files on every run (overwrote existing files)
  - After: Checks if file exists before uploading, skips if already present
  - Matches Function 3 derivative behavior (idempotent - safe to re-run)
  - Tracks separately: uploaded (new), skipped (already exist), failed
  - Results dialog shows breakdown of upload activity
  - Log messages show both original and Azure filenames: "⏩ Wit 100.JPG (dg_1778853759.JPG) already exists in Azure - skipping upload"
  - Function 3 derivatives also show Azure names: "⏩ Derivatives (dg_123_SMALL.jpg, dg_123_TN.jpg) already exist in Azure - skipping"
- **Case preservation from filenames**: Original case now preserved when generating titles and display names
  - Before: "SSWB001.jpg" → title "Sswb" (title case applied)
  - After: "SSWB001.jpg" → title "SSWB" (original case preserved)
  - Compound objects now store both `text_base` (lowercase for grouping) and `display_text_base` (original case)
  - Display names extracted from first child's raw filename stem before normalization
  - Applies to titles in CSV exports and compound object display in Function 1 results
  - Underscores and hyphens still converted to spaces for readability
- **File-to-ID mapping**: Network-mount-agnostic using stable relative paths
  - File-to-ID mappings now use stable paths (everything after `/Volumes/<mount>/`) as keys
  - IDs persist when network mounts change names or paths
  - Example: `/Volumes/OldServer/photos/img.jpg` and `/Volumes/NewServer/photos/img.jpg` map to same ID
  - Local paths (not under `/Volumes/`) continue using full paths as keys
  - Full current paths still tracked in object data for file access
  - Applies to both individual files and compound object folder paths
  - Eliminates "145 new, 0 reused" problem when working directory path changes
- **Function 4 CSV merge**: Row order preservation strictly enforced
  - Core CSV row order is NEVER changed during comparison or merge
  - Updates cell values only for matching records (by filename)
  - New records are appended to the bottom of the file
  - Manual curation, hierarchies, and user-controlled ordering are preserved
  - Changed from pandas outer merge to custom merge logic that maintains row position
  - Critical for collections where record order has semantic meaning
- **Status messages**: Enhanced with clickable log links
  - Status messages can now include clickable "check log" button
  - Replaced simple TextField with flexible Container that holds Text or Row with TextButton
  - Used for directory warnings and duplicate object ID errors
  - Clicking "check log" opens full log file in popup dialog (800x600px)
  - Consistent with pattern used in Function 3 and Function 4 result dialogs
  - Fixed `on_copy_status_click()` to extract text from both simple and clickable status formats
- **Compound parent filename indexing**: Compound parents now use underscore-prefixed first child filename
  - Before: Compound parents had blank filename (required objectid fallback for indexing)
  - After: Compound parents have `_<first_child_filename>` (e.g., `_photo_001.jpg`)
  - Maintains filename as source of truth for ALL objects (children, standalone, and compound parents)
  - Underscore prefix clearly differentiates compound parents from actual files
  - First child is determined deterministically (numbered files first by sequence, then unnumbered alphabetically)
- **Function 1 compound analysis**: Enhanced to capture first child's filename
  - Sorts children (numbered first, then unnumbered) before compound creation
  - Stores `first_child_filename` in compound object data structure
  - Ensures consistent "first child" selection across multiple runs
- **Function 2 CSV export**: Updated to write underscore-prefixed filenames for compound parents
  - CSV filename column: `_photo_001.jpg` for compound parent, `photo_001.jpg` for first child
  - Eliminates need for special handling of blank filenames
  - Simplifies downstream processing (no dual-path logic needed)
  - Compound parents do not receive `object_location` values (no physical file to reference)
- **Function 3 derivative generation**: Enhanced to populate compound parent derivative URLs
  - Still skips compound parents during derivative generation (no physical file)
  - After processing all children, automatically populates compound parent derivatives
  - Finds first child by removing underscore from parent filename
  - Copies `image_small` and `image_thumb` URLs from first child to parent
  - Avoids duplicate uploads to Azure (derivatives already exist for first child)
  - Log messages show which compound parents received derivative URLs
  - Pre-scan correctly counts compound parents as skipped files

### Added
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: New documentation file
  - Comprehensive explanation of compound filename indexing decision
  - Technical rationale and benefits
  - Implementation details across all functions
  - Example CSV structure showing underscore-prefixed filenames
- **Compound parent derivative inheritance** (Function 3)
  - Automatic URL population after child processing completes
  - Matches parent filename (without underscore) to child filename
  - Inherits both image_small and image_thumb from first child
  - Eliminates redundant Azure storage of identical derivatives

### Documentation
- **FUNCTION_2_EXPORT_CSV.md**: Updated compound object examples
  - CSV examples now show `_wit_001.jpg` for compound parent
  - Note explains underscore prefix maintains filename as source of truth
  - Updated field descriptions to reflect new approach
- **FUNCTION_3_GENERATE_DERIVATIVES.md**: Added compound object derivative handling section
  - Explains automatic derivative URL inheritance
  - Documents that no derivatives are generated for compound parents
  - Clarifies that derivatives already exist in Azure for first child
  - Example CSV showing parent and child with shared derivative URLs
  - Updated "What Gets Processed" and "What Gets Skipped" sections
- **FUNCTION_4_COMPARE_MERGE_CSV.md**: Updated note about compound parent filenames
  - Now mentions underscore-prefixed filenames instead of blank filenames
- **Code comments**: Updated throughout for clarity
  - Function 1: "Use first child's filename as compound's filename index"
  - Function 2: "Use first child's filename with underscore prefix for indexing"
  - Function 3: "Compound parent (no physical file) - will populate derivatives after children processed"

### Technical Details
**analyze_compound_objects() function**:
- Sorts parsed_items: `numbered_items.sort(key=lambda x: x['number'])`, then `unnumbered_items.sort(key=lambda x: x['filename'])`
- Extracts first: `first_child_filename = sorted_items[0]['filename']`
- Stores in compound: `"first_child_filename": first_child_filename`

**CSV Export (Function 2)**:
- Compound parent filename: `row[col] = f"_{first_child}" if first_child else ''`
- Writes underscore-prefixed value to filename column
- No object_location populated for compound parents

**Derivative Generation (Function 3)**:
- Processing loop: `if filename.startswith('_'): skipped_count += 1; continue`
- After processing: Loop through rows to find compound parents (underscore-prefixed)
- For each: Remove underscore, find matching child row, copy image_small and image_thumb
- Logs success/warnings for each compound parent processed

### Rationale
This unified indexing approach:
1. **Eliminates complexity**: No need for 2-pronged approach (filename vs objectid)
2. **Maintains consistency**: Filename is always the index - no exceptions
3. **Clear differentiation**: Underscore prefix visually distinguishes compound parents
4. **Deterministic**: First child selection is repeatable across runs
5. **Simpler code**: Fewer conditionals, easier to maintain
6. **Efficient derivatives**: No duplicate Azure storage, compound parents reference existing child derivatives

### Breaking Changes
None - this is an internal implementation detail. Existing workflows continue unchanged.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-05-14

### Summary
Version 1.5.2 changes Function 4 to use `filename` as the comparison key instead of `objectid`, treating filename as the source of truth for record matching. Also corrects csvdiff dependency version and restricts CSV file selection to only DART_export files.

### Changed
- **Function 4 comparison key**: Changed from `objectid` to `filename` throughout
  - Both pandas and csvdiff methods now use `filename` as the unique identifier
  - Column validation: Now checks for `filename` column (was `objectid`)
  - Duplicate detection: Checks for duplicate `filename` values (was `objectid`)
  - Merge operation: `on='filename'` in pandas merge (was `on='objectid'`)
  - csvdiff: `index_columns=['filename']` in diff_files call (was using objectid)
  - Empty filename handling: Multiple rows with empty filenames allowed (used to disable objects from display)
  - Preview display: Uses `filename` as identifier, falls back to `objectid` when filename is blank
  - Error messages: Updated to reference "filename" instead of "objectid"
  - Output columns: First column is now `filename` (was `objectid`)
- **Function 4 CSV file selection**: Now only considers `DART_export*.csv` files
  - Auto-selects newest DART_export CSV as "new" file for comparison
  - Ignores other CSV files (e.g., core metadata, merge outputs) in working directory
  - Clearer error messages mentioning DART_export files specifically
  - Log messages indicate which DART_export file was auto-selected
- **Function 4 csvdiff color-coded viewer**: Interactive visual overlay for csvdiff results
  - "Review & Merge Changes" button in csvdiff result dialog
  - **Interactive merge capability**:
    - Checkboxes for each addition (one per record) - checked by default
    - **Field-level checkboxes** for changes (one per field, not per record)
    - Normal changes: Checked by default for quick approval
    - Data loss changes: **DISABLED (grayed out)** requiring "⚠️ Enable" button click
    - Select which specific field changes to accept
    - "Merge Selected Changes" button applies only checked field changes
    - Automatic backup created before merge
    - Confirmation dialog shows counts (additions + field changes) before merging
  - Blue background: New records (added) - checked by default
  - Gray background: Missing records (removed) - read-only, not merged
  - Red → Green highlight: Changed field values showing old → new
  - **⚠️ Orange warning**: Data loss detection - highlights when old values are replaced with empty
    - Uses negated arrow (⃠→) and orange background
    - Automatically unchecked by default
    - Warning banner at top shows count of data loss changes
    - Helps catch unintentional field clearing
  - Shows all additions and changes (not just first 10/20)
  - Scrollable view with truncated long values for readability

### Fixed
- **Dependencies**: Corrected csvdiff requirement to `csvdiff>=0.3.0` (was incorrectly set to >=1.7.0)
  - Latest available version is 0.3.3, not 1.7.0
- **Function 4 glob pattern**: Fixed missing underscore in DART_export file search pattern
- **Function 4 csvdiff integration**: Fixed API usage to use `diff_files()` instead of non-existent `load_csv()` and `compare()`
  - Now correctly calls `diff_files(old_csv, new_csv, index_columns=['filename'])`

### Documentation
- **FUNCTION_4_COMPARE_MERGE_CSV.md**: Updated throughout
  - Requirements section: Now requires `filename` column
  - Status classifications: Refer to `filename` matching
  - Example tables: Use `filename` (e.g., "photo_001.jpg") instead of `objectid`
  - Validation/error handling: Updated messages
  - Comparison logic: Updated merge key references
- **README.md**: Updated Function 4 description
  - "Compare two CSV files by filename" (was "by objectid")
  - "Validates unique filenames" (was "unique objectids")
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Updated v1.5.1 and v1.5.0 entries to reflect filename key

### Technical Details
- pandas merge: `old_valid.merge(new_valid, on='filename', ...)`
- csvdiff: `diff_files(old_csv, new_csv, index_columns=['filename'])`
- Shared columns detection: `shared_cols.discard('filename')` excludes filename from comparison
- First data row still skipped (contains duplicate headings)
- Empty/NaN filename rows handled separately and marked as new/missing_in_new

### Rationale
- Filename identified as "source of truth" for record identity
- More intuitive for file-based workflows
- Aligns with asset management best practices

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Summary
Version 1.2.0 represents a major architectural upgrade focused on adopting Digital Grinnell standards and enhancing data persistence:

**Key Highlights:**
- Integrated with `common-DG-utilities` shared library for ecosystem consistency
- Replaced custom filename-based IDs with standard `dg_<epoch>` format
- Implemented permanent file-to-ID mappings (IDs never change once assigned)
- Added persistent file selection across app restarts
- Enhanced with full file path tracking to prevent collisions
- Implemented true compound object system with parentid tracking

### Added
- **Common DG Utilities Integration**: Imported shared utilities from `../common-DG-utilities`
  - Added `common_dg_utilities` package to dependencies
  - Enables code reuse across Digital Grinnell applications
- **Standard DG Identifier System**: Function 1 now uses standard `dg_<epoch>` format
  - All identifiers follow Digital Grinnell standard: `dg_<epoch_time>`
  - Epoch-based generation ensures global uniqueness
  - Automatic collision detection and handling (increments if duplicate found)
  - Consistent with other Digital Grinnell applications
- **Persistent ID Assignment**: File-to-ID mappings stored in settings
  - Once a file receives an ID, it NEVER changes
  - Mappings use **full file paths** as keys to prevent collisions
  - Stored per working folder in `file_to_id_map`
  - Running Function 1 again reuses existing IDs for known file paths
  - Only generates new IDs for files not previously seen
  - Shows statistics: "X new, Y reused" in results
- **Persistent File Selection**: Selected files remembered across app restarts
  - File picker selections stored in persistent.json
  - On app restart, previously selected files are restored and displayed
  - No need to re-select files each time you open the app
  - Supports both single and multiple file selections
- **Function 0 Enhancement**: New `use_working_folder_for_file_selection` boolean setting
  - Controls initial directory for file picker dialog
  - When `true`: Opens file picker in working/outputs folder
  - When `false`: Opens file picker in inputs folder (overrides Flet default behavior)
  - Default value: `false`
- **Multiple File Selection**: File picker now supports selecting multiple files simultaneously
  - Smart display: Shows single file path or count with first 3 filenames
  - Storage: Maintains both `last_file` (single) and `last_files` (comma-separated) for compatibility
  - Helper function: `get_selected_files()` returns list of all selected files as Path objects
- **Compound Object Implementation**: Function 1 now creates true compound objects with parentid tracking
  - Compound objects have their own `dg_<epoch>` identifiers
  - Compound objects are associated with the **folder path** containing their children
  - Compound IDs stored using key format: `{folder_path}::COMPOUND::{text_base}`
  - Compound IDs persist across runs - same folder + text base = same ID
  - Child objects track their parent via `parentid` field (not vice-versa)
  - Text-based filename grouping (numbers ignored - used for sequencing)
  - Groups require 2+ files to form a compound
  - Files that don't match any group become standalone objects (`parentid = None`)
  - Enhanced display: Shows compounds with folder path and children indented, standalone objects separately
- **Debug Logging for Function 1**: Comprehensive debug output tracking inputs, processing, and outputs
  - Logs input sources, identifier generation, and validation
  - All debug messages prefixed with `[DEBUG]` for easy identification
- **Function 1 Enhancement**: Now processes selected files from Files Selection
  - If files are selected, analyzes only those files (ignores Inputs Folder)
  - Falls back to scanning Inputs Folder if no files are selected
  - Allows precise control over which files to analyze
- **Function 1 Uniqueness Validation**: Automatic detection and reporting of duplicate identifiers
  - Validates all generated identifiers are unique
  - Shows detailed error dialog if duplicates detected (extremely rare with epoch-based IDs)
- **Function 1 Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Third pass algorithm improved with trailing separator normalization
  - Automatically strips trailing spaces, underscores, and hyphens from extracted base names
  - Handles double spaces and inconsistent trailing separators
  - Example: "Traditions and Encounters - " and "Traditions and Encounters" now normalize to same base
  - Ensures more reliable grouping for files with spacing variations

### Changed
- **Log File Location**: Dynamically created in `{working_folder}/logfiles/`
  - Logs are now stored in the working/outputs folder for better organization
  - Creates `logfiles` subdirectory within your working folder
  - Initial startup uses `~/DART-data/logfiles/` until working folder is set
  - Automatically switches to working folder logs when folder is selected
  - Keeps logs with the project data they relate to
- **Folder Naming Consistency**: Updated all references to use plural forms
  - "Input Folder" → "Inputs Folder"
  - "Output Folder" → "Outputs Folder"
  - "Working/Output Folder" → "Working/Outputs Folder"
  - Applied to UI labels, dialog titles, status messages, and error messages
- **File Selection Terminology**: Updated to plural forms
  - "File Selection" → "Files Selection"
  - "Select File" → "Select Files"
  - Dialog title: "Select File" → "Select Files"
- **File Picker Behavior**: Enhanced with smart directory selection
  - Respects `use_working_folder_for_file_selection` setting
  - Falls back to inputs folder when setting is false and inputs folder is available
  - Improved user workflow by reducing navigation steps

### Removed
- **Filename-Based Object ID System**: Replaced with standard DG identifiers
  - Previous system derived IDs from filenames (e.g., "wit-001" from "Wit 001.JPG")
  - New system uses epoch-based identifiers (e.g., "dg_1736712345")
  - Eliminates complexity from filename parsing and pattern matching
  - Note: Compound object grouping feature retained for future use with modifications

### Documentation
- Updated FUNCTION_1_ANALYZE_ASSETS.md for standard DG identifiers
  - Documented new `dg_<epoch>` format and benefits
  - Removed filename-based object ID generation rules
  - Simplified examples to show epoch-based ID assignment
  - Compound grouping documentation will be updated when modifications are implemented
- Updated FUNCTION_0_APP_SETTINGS.md with new `use_working_folder_for_file_selection` setting
- Revised all function documentation to use plural folder naming (Inputs/Outputs)
- Updated FUNCTION_2_COUNT_FILES.md with plural terminology
- Enhanced notes section explaining file picker behavior based on settings
- Updated README.md with new log file location (`./logfiles/`)
- Updated QUICKSTART.md to reflect current function list and dependencies

### Technical Details
**Standard DG Identifier Implementation:**
- Imported `generate_unique_id()` from `common_dg_utilities.dg_utils`
- IDs generated as `dg_<epoch_time>` where epoch is Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970)
- Uniqueness enforced via `page.session.generated_ids` set
- Automatic collision handling increments epoch if duplicate detected (rare)

**Persistent ID Mapping:**
- Mappings stored in `dart_settings.json` per working folder
- Dictionary structure: `{"/full/path/to/file.jpg": "dg_1736712345"}`
- Full file paths used as keys to prevent collisions
- Loaded at start of Function 1, saved after new IDs generated
- Object data structure enhanced: `{objectid, filepath, filename}`

**Persistent File Selection:**
- Added `last_files` field to persistent.json `ui_state`
- Comma-separated list of full file paths
- Restored on app startup with smart display logic
- Helper function `get_initial_file_display()` formats display text
- Maintains backward compatibility with single-file `last_file` field

**Compound Object Implementation:**
- **Folder-Based Association**: Compounds are associated with the folder path containing their children
  - More logical than file-based tracking (compound has no single file)
  - Folder path provides stable, persistent reference point
  - Same folder + text base = same compound ID across runs
- **Intelligent Pattern Analysis**: Three-pass grouping algorithm finds what filenames have in common
  - **Pass 1**: Extract prefixes from numbered files: `re.match(r'^(.+?)[\s_\-]*(\d+)$', stem)`
    - Handles leading numbers: "100 Nights-1" → prefix "100 nights", seq 1
  - **Pass 2**: Match unnumbered files against known numbered prefixes
    - Checks if unnumbered filename starts with any numbered prefix
    - Uses longest matching prefix (most specific)
    - Validates separator after prefix (space, underscore, hyphen)
    - "Wit Poster" starts with "wit" → matched
    - "AnnaChristie-F14-Program" starts with "annachristie-f14" → matched
  - **Pass 3**: Find common patterns among remaining unnumbered files
    - Extracts common base by removing last word after separator: `re.match(r'^(.+?)[\s_\-]+\w+$', stem)`
    - Groups files sharing the same base (2+ files, 3+ char base)
    - "Traditions and Encounters - Poster" → base "traditions and encounters"
    - "Traditions and Encounters_Program" → base "traditions and encounters" → grouped!
  - Weighted matching: requires 3+ character prefix for grouping
  - Case-insensitive comparison
  - No hardcoded suffix list - adapts to actual file patterns
- **Sequence Detection**: Analyzes numbered files for sequential patterns
  - Calculates average gap and maximum gap between sorted numbers
  - Sequential if: avg gap ≤ 2.0 and max gap ≤ 5 (tolerates missing numbers)
  - **Zero-Padding**: Automatically calculates padding width from max number
  - Reports sequence details: range, gaps, missing values, padding recommendation
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive analysis logged for each group
  - File counts (numbered vs unnumbered)
  - Sequence analysis with statistics
  - Zero-padding recommendations
  - Grouping decisions with rationale
  - Examples: "wit 001.jpg", "wit poster.jpg" → both grouped under prefix "wit"
  - Examples: "100 nights-1.jpg", "100 nights-20.jpg" → grouped under "100 nights"
- **Smart Display**: Children displayed in proper sequence order
  - Numbered files sorted by sequence, then unnumbered alphabetically
  - Sequence numbers shown with zero-padding: `[01]`, `[02]`, `[10]`
  - Visual confirmation of proper grouping and ordering
- Compound objects created for groups with 2+ files
- Folder path extracted from first child: `Path(filepath).parent`
- Compound key format: `{folder_path}::COMPOUND::{text_base}` for ID mapping
- Checks for existing compound IDs before generating new ones
- Each compound gets unique `dg_<epoch>` ID via `generate_unique_id(page)`
- Object types: `"compound"` (has folder_path), `"child"` (has file + parentid), `"single"` (no parent)
- Object structure: `{objectid, parentid, type, filepath, filename}` for children
- Compound structure: `{objectid, type, text_base, child_count, folder_path}` for compounds
- Display organizes by compound with folder path shown and children indented

**Dependencies:**
- Added `common-DG-utilities` as editable package: `-e ../common-DG-utilities`
- Requires sibling directory structure: `GitHub/common-DG-utilities/` and `GitHub/DART/`
